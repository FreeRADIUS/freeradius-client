Description: /bin/login replacement which uses the RADIUS protocol for authentication.
 Radiusclient is a /bin/login replacement  which gets called by a getty
 to log  in a user and  to setup the user's  login environment.  Normal
 login programs just  check the login name and  password which the user
 entered  against the local  password file  (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow).
 In  contrast to  that Radiusclient  also uses  the RADIUS  protocol to
 authenticate the user.
