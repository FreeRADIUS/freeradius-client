# RADIUS server to use for authentication requests.
# optionally you can specify a the port number on which is remote
# RADIUS listens separated by a colon from the hostname. if
# no port is specified /etc/services is consulted of the radius
# service. if this fails also a compiled in default is used.
# For IPv6 addresses use the '[IPv6]:port' format, or
# simply '[IPv6]'.

# For DTLS with PSK authentication, the following format is valid:

# In TLS/DTLS the acct server directive is ignored.

# TLS/DTLS settings

# The type of authentication to use for the radius server.
# The available options are 'tls' and 'dtls', or should be commented
# out to use plain UDP. TLS and DTLS authentication can be used
# with PSK keys or X.509 certificate authentication (see below).
serv-auth-type	tls

# The CA certificate to be used to verify the server's certificate.
# Does not need to be set if we are using PSK (pre-shared keys).
tls-ca-file @pkgsysconfdir@/ca.pem

# Our certificate and key files. These identify this NAS to the
# radius servers. They don't need to be set if using PSK.

tls-key-file @pkgsysconfdir@/key.pem

# Used for debugging purposed. It will disable hostname verification
# on the connected host. Not recommended to be enabled.
