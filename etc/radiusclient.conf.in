# if you specify "radius,local" then the RADIUS server is asked
# first then the local one. if only one keyword is specified only
# this server is asked.

# RADIUS settings

# RADIUS server to use for authentication requests. this config
# item can appear more then one time. if multiple servers are
# defined they are tried in a round robin fashion if one
# server is not answering.
# optionally you can specify a the port number on which is remote
# RADIUS listens separated by a colon from the hostname. if
# no port is specified /etc/services is consulted of the radius
# service. if this fails also a compiled in default is used.
# For IPv6 addresses use the '[IPv6]:port:secret' format, or
# simply '[IPv6]'.

# The length of time in seconds that we skip a nonresponsive RADIUS

# are tried only after all other non-dead servers have been tried and

# does not respond to an authentication/accounting request transmissions. 
# When the interval expires, the "dead" server would be re-tried again,
# and if it's still down then it will be considered "dead" for another
# such interval and so on. This option is no-op if there is only one
# server in the list. Set to 0 in order to disable the feature.
